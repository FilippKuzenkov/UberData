This is a groject where I have tried to implement a pipeline to run data from Google Cloud through Mage, then work on it in BigQuery and then create a dashboard in PowerBI.

Unfortunately, in 90% of cases Googles Vm doesnt want to connect me to Mage, despite changing browseres, resetting the firewall rules etc

Therefore this project is put on hold, and I will focus on the 100 Day Challenge and the next upcoming project I have in mind
